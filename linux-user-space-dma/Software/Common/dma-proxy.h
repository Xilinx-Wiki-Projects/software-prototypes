 /* This header file is shared between the DMA Proxy test application and the DMA Proxy device driver. It defines the
 * shared interface to allow DMA transfers to be done from user space.
 *
 * A set of channel buffers are created by the driver for the transmit and receive channel. The application may choose
 * to use only a subset of the channel buffers to allow prioritization of transmit vs receive.
 *
 * Note: the buffer in the data structure should be 1st in the channel interface so that the buffer is cached aligned,
 * otherwise there may be issues when using cached memory.

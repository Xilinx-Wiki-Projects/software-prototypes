/* DMA Proxy Test Application
 *
 * This application is intended to be used with the DMA Proxy device driver. It provides
 * an example application showing how to use the device driver to do user space DMA
 * operations.
 *
 * The driver allocates coherent memory which is non-cached in a s/w coherent system
 * or cached in a h/w coherent system.
 *
 * Transmit and receive buffers in that memory are mapped to user space such that the
 * application can send and receive data using DMA channels (transmit and receive).
 *
 * It has been tested with AXI DMA and AXI MCDMA systems with transmit looped back to
 * receive. Note that the receive channel of the AXI DMA throttles the transmit with
 * a loopback while this is not the case with AXI MCDMA.
 *
 * Build information: The pthread library is required for linking. Compiler optimization
 * makes a very big difference in performance with -O3 being good performance and
 * -O0 being very low performance.
 *
 * The user should tune the number of channels and channel names to match the device
 * tree.
 *
 * More complete documentation is contained in the device driver (dma-proxy.c).

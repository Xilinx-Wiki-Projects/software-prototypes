/* DMA Proxy
 *
 * This module is designed to be a small example of a DMA device driver that is
 * a client to the DMA Engine using the AXI DMA / MCDMA driver. It serves as a proxy
 * for kernel space DMA control to a user space application.
 *
 * A zero copy scheme is provided by allowing user space to mmap a kernel allocated
 * memory region into user space, referred to as a set of channel buffers. Ioctl functions 
 * are provided to start a DMA transfer (non-blocking), finish a DMA transfer (blocking) 
 * previously started, or start and finish a DMA transfer blocking until it is complete.
 * An input argument which specifies a channel buffer number (0 - N) to be used for the
 * transfer is required.
 *
 * By default the kernel memory allocated for user space mapping is going to be 
 * non-cached at this time. Non-cached memory is pretty slow for the application.
 * A h/w coherent system for MPSOC has been tested and is recommended for higher
 * performance applications. 
 *
 * Hardware coherency requires the following items in the system as documented on the 
 * Xilinx wiki and summarized below::
 *   The AXI DMA read and write channels AXI signals must be tied to the correct state to
 *    generate coherent transactions.
 *   An HPC slave port on MPSOC is required
 *   The CCI of MPSOC must be initialized prior to the APU booting Linux
 *   A dma-coherent property is added in the device tree for the proxy driver.
 *
 * There is an associated user space application, dma_proxy_test.c, and dma_proxy.h
 * that works with this device driver.
 *
 * The hardware design was tested with an AXI DMA / MCDMA  with scatter gather and
 * with the transmit channel looped back to the receive channel. It should
 * work with or without scatter gather as the scatter gather mentioned in the 
 * driver is only at the s/w framework level rather than in the hw.
 *
 * This driver is character driver which creates devices that user space can
 * access for each DMA channel, such as /dev/dma_proxy_rx and /dev/dma_proxy_tx.
 * The number and names of channels are taken from the device tree.
 * Multiple instances of the driver (with multiple IPs) are also supported.

 * An internal test mode is provided to allow it to be self testing without the 
 * need for a user space application and this mode is good for making bigger
 * changes to this driver.
 *
 * This driver is designed to be simple to help users get familiar with how to 
 * use the DMA driver provided by Xilinx which uses the Linux DMA Engine. 
 *
 * To use this driver a node must be added into the device tree.  Add a 
 * node similar to the examples below adjusting the dmas property to match the
 * name of the AXI DMA / MCDMA node.
 * 
 * The dmas property contains pairs with the first of each pair being a reference
 * to the DMA IP in the device tree and the second of each pair being the
 * channel of the DMA IP. For the AXI DMA IP the transmit channel is always 0 and
 * the receive is always 1. For the AXI MCDMA IP the 1st transmit channel is
 * always 0 and receive channels start at 16 since there can be a maximum of 16
 * transmit channels. Each name in the dma-names corresponds to a pair in the dmas
 * property and is only a logical name that allows user space access to the channel
 * such that the name can be any name as long as it is unique.
 *
 *	For h/w coherent systems with MPSoC, the property dma-coherent can be added
 * to the node in the device tree. 
 * 
 * Example device tree nodes: 
 *
 * For AXI DMA with transmit and receive channels with a loopback in hardware
 * 
 * dma_proxy {
 *   compatible ="xlnx,dma_proxy";
 *   dmas = <&axi_dma_1_loopback 0  &axi_dma_1_loopback 1>;
 *   dma-names = "dma_proxy_tx", "dma_proxy_rx";
 * };
 *
 * For AXI DMA with only the receive channel
 * 
 * dma_proxy2 {
 *   compatible ="xlnx,dma_proxy";
 *   dmas = <&axi_dma_0_noloopback 1>;
 *   dma-names = "dma_proxy_rx_only";
 * };
 *
 * For AXI MCDMA with two channels 
 *
 * dma_proxy3 {
 *   compatible ="xlnx,dma_proxy";
 *   dmas = <&axi_mcdma_0 0  &axi_mcdma_0 16 &axi_mcdma_0 1 &axi_mcdma_0 17> ;
 *   dma-names = "dma_proxy_tx_0", "dma_proxy_rx_0", "dma_proxy_tx_1", "dma_proxy_rx_1";
 * };
